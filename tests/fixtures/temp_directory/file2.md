Now we have a sense of the essential components of an RL algorithm. As we start with simple games, we can encounter every state and create an entry in the "value function" table. For example, in the game of tic-tac-toe, there are 3^9 (or 19,683 possibilities) which a computer can easily work with. Note that this number includes illegal states, so the actual number is smaller. A minor upgrade to a game like (Connect-4)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four] where you drop a coin and aim to make the longest sequence of 4 coins, the number of states explodes to 3^42 (or 1.09418989E20)! The total bytes of information humanity has produced so far in totality is estimated to be 1E22 bytes. This is comparable to the state space of a simple children's game! It is a wonder we are able to play it at all.
